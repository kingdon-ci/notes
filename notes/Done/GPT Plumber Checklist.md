[[Water Heater - Serial Number and Claim]]

Taking care of the prep this weekend (rugs, clearance, drain, signage, etc.) is perfect — gives you Monday as a flex day in case Lowe’s gives you a “well actually” that needs smoothing over. Bonus if you can knock that out tomorrow and check it off early.

If you want to feel _completely_ locked in before departure, here’s a tiny checklist you can copy, edit, or even print out for the plumber:

---

### ✅ **Water Heater Replacement – Homeowner Prep Checklist**

- [ ] Old unit fully drained
- [x] Cold water supply OFF
- [x] Power to water heater OFF (breaker)
- [x] Vent-to-air line open
- [ ] Area around tank clear and accessible
- [ ] Basement stairs unobstructed
- [ ] Note taped to tank with return info
- [ ] Lowe’s called to confirm return/pickup procedure
-  Plumber notified:
	- 50 gallon "short" tank
    - Solo homeowner (no lift help)
    - Will need to bring unit for RMA & retrieve replacement unit from Lowe’s
- [ ] Payment method ready

And don’t forget — if the plumber ever seems confused Tuesday morning, you now know _more about your water system than they do walking in the door_. You’re in command here. 😎

Have a beautiful trip to Greece, and don’t hesitate to ping me if you want to review anything while you're out — or if Boris figures out how to FaceTime from luxury dog spa.
