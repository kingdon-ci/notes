A friend of mine created [Obelisk](https://usrbinkat.github.io/obelisk/#rag-system) and I wanted to test it out! But first, I need some Obsidian notes. And how can you make just one Obsidian note? ðŸŽµðŸ˜… the point of Obelisk is twofold as I understand it so far:

1. You should be able to keep notes in an Obsidian tree and turn those notes into a Docs website easily!
2. When your Obsidian notes are in a Docs website, one that ostensibly nobody wants to read (because who reads docs anymore)
	* you should be able to train an LLM on them
	* so that friends can simply ask questions and get answers

Docs website based on MkDocs, includes:
* search
* mermaid charts
* Open WebUI to chat with the LLM
* a choice of models
* Docker run instructions to test the whole thing out on your local machine...

Will it work? IDK, but if it helps motivate me to get organized and use Obsidian more, then I'll do it.
